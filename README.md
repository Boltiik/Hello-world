# Hello-world
until don't know

I am begining new adventure to programming world! I like reading comics and manga(my favorite is from BUBBLE), 
drawing and watching cartoons. Also I like python and java.
Before I wrote programs for smartphones in Android Studio but that time it was hard for me. 
Soon I can return to it and try again.
